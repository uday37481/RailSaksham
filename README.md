## Features

### üöä Real-Time Train Simulation
- Animated train movement along railway tracks
- Multiple train types (Local, Express, Freight) with distinct behaviors
- Dynamic collision avoidance and traffic management
- Real-time status updates and delay tracking

### üéõÔ∏è Controller Dashboard
- **Left Panel**: Train details with sortable list, priority levels, and delay status
- **Main Panel**: Interactive railway network visualization with Mumbai suburban stations
- **Right Panel**: AI-powered recommendations for schedule optimization

### üß† AI Recommendations
- Schedule adjustment suggestions
- Route optimization proposals
- Priority management recommendations
- Confidence scoring for each recommendation

### üé® Professional UI/UX
- Dark control room aesthetic with glowing track lines
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and tablet
- Real-time visual feedback with color-coded status indicators
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Custom hooks** for simulation logic
- **SVG-based** network visualization
- **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd railsaksham
```

2. Install dependencies

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Start/Pause Simulation**: Use the control button to start or pause the train simulation
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to control simulation speed (0.1x to 3.0x)
3. **Select Trains**: Click on trains in the visualization or train list to inspect details
4. **Add Delays**: Use the "Add Delay" button to simulate operational disruptions
5. **AI Recommendations**: Review and approve/override AI suggestions in the right panel

### Train Status Indicators
- **Green**: On-time operation
- **Yellow**: Minor delays (1-10 minutes)
- **Red**: Major delays (10+ minutes)

### Track Status Colors
- **Green**: Normal operation
- **Yellow**: Delayed/Warning
- **Red**: Blocked/Critical
- **Orange**: Alternative route

## Data Structure

The application uses mock data for:
- **Stations**: Mumbai suburban network including Thane, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar, Dadar, Kurla, Bandra, Andheri, and Borivali
- **Tracks**: Connecting routes between stations with real-time status
- **Trains**: Multiple train types with varying priorities and schedules
- **AI Recommendations**: Dynamic suggestions based on network conditions
